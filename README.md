# Wildlife Strikes: A Hidden Threat at Akanu Ibiam Intâ€™l Airport

Wildlife activities pose a significant safety and operational risk to aviation. While working at Akanu Ibiam International Airport, I observed how field officers meticulously recorded daily wildlife activity and bird strike incidents. This inspired me to analyze the data to uncover patterns that could guide better decision-making.
The goal of this project was to transform raw observations into actionable insights that would:
â€¢	Help the unit head allocate resources more effectively,
â€¢	Strengthen his case for vegetation management on the airport grounds, and
â€¢	Support aviation safety with evidence rather than intuition.
By analyzing this dataset, I was able to answer critical questions about when, where, and how wildlife strikes occurâ€”and provide recommendations that can directly influence airport safety strategy.


## I answered three key questioons
1.	When are aircraft most at risk?
(Which time of day records the highest wildlife activity and collisions?)
2.	Which species pose the greatest threat?
(What is the yearly trend of wildlife species activity and their share of collisions?)
3.	How do wildlife strikes impact flight operations?
(What is the collision status, phase of flight affected, and operational consequences?)


## Key Insights from the analysis
â€¢	Most collisions occur during morning hours, when wildlife are mostly observed during landings and take-offs, indicating higher risk.
â€¢	A small number of species (black kite and guinea fowl) account for the majority of the strikes.
â€¢	Collisions during landing roll phase pose the greatest operational risk, leading to delays and maintenance costs.


## Recommendations
â€¢	Focus wildlife control resources on morning hours when activities peaks.
â€¢	Implement targeted deterrents against black kite and guinea fowl.
â€¢	Prioritize vegetation management around runways to reduce bird congregation.


## Next Steps

*Explore predictive modeling of seasonal patterns to anticipate and prevent high-risk periods.
